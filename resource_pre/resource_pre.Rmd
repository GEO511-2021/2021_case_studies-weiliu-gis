## What??? :confused:

**gganimate** is an extension of the ggplot2 package for creating animated ggplots. It provides a range of new functionality that can be added to the plot object in order to customize how it should change with time.

## Why??? :relieved:

- **TRANSITION**: You want your data to *change*.
- **SHADOW**: You want your data to have *memory*.
- **VIEW**: You want your data to tell *stories*.

## How??? :smiley:

### Basic Functions

Before jumping to specific examples, here are two basic functions in gganimate that need introducing.\

- **transition_\*()**
&nbsp;&nbsp;It defines how the data should be spread out and how it relates to itself across time.\
- **ease_aes()**
&nbsp;&nbsp;It defines how different aesthetics should be eased during transitions.\

### Examples

#### :one: Start with a static plot
In this part, we will first create a static plot with the dataset, *iris*, using the ggplot() function. And in the following steps, we will add several animation features to this original plot.\
(The packages of ggplot2 and gganimate have already been loaded in the environment.)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(gganimate)
```

```{r}
str(iris) # Here is the structure of iris dataset (in case you don't remember.)
```

```{r, fig.align='center'}
p <- ggplot(iris, aes(x=Petal.Width, y=Petal.Length)) +
  geom_point()
plot(p)
```

#### :two: Add transitions
There are a number of options for us to select (shown in the table below :arrow_down:).\

Function Name | Brief Description
:------------:|---------------------------------------
transition_states | Transition between several distinct stages of the data
transition_time | Transition through distinct states in time
transition_filter | Transition between different filters
transition_events | Transition individual events in and out
transition_manual | Create an animation by specifying the frame membership directly
transition_reveal | Reveal data along a given dimension
...   |...   

But, to make it straightforward, in this part, we only take **transition_states()** function for example. :sparkles:

```{r}
anim1 <- p +
  transition_states(Species,
                    transition_length=2,
                    state_length=1)
anim1
```

#### :three: Control easing of aesthetics

In this part, we will use the **ease_aes()** funtion.\

Easing defines how a value change to another during tweening. Will it progress linearly, or maybe start slowly and then build up momentum.\

When setting nothing in ease_aes(), the default animation will be built with a linear model, like what we have in part two.\

There are many animation type available (shown in the table below :arrow_down:).

Easing function | Brief Description
:--------------:|-----------------------------------
quadratic | Models a power-of-2 function
cubic | Models a power-of-3 function
sine | Models a sine function
exponential | Models an exponential function
elastic | Models an elastic release of energy
bounce | Models the bouncing of a ball
...   |...   

When deciding the easing type, we also choose certain modifier for the animation. :arrow_down:

Modifier | Brief Description
:-------:|---------------------------------------
-in | The easing function is applied as-is
-out | The easing function is applied in reverse
-in-out | The first half of the transition it is applied as-is, while in the last half it is reversed

Then we need an example to make it clear. :sparkles:

```{r, fig.align='center'}
anim1 +
  ease_aes(y='cubic-out')
```

Try another option... :sparkles:
```{r, fig.align='center'}
anim1 +
  ease_aes(y='bounce-in') # Bouncing~~~ But only want them to bounce vetically.
```

#### :four: Add titles and subtitles

gganimate use similar grammar like ggplot when defining the titles, but there are some differences. Let's see. :sparkles:

```{r}
anim1 +
  ease_aes(y='bounce-in') +
  ggtitle("Now showing {closest_state}",
          subtitle="Frame {frame} of {nframes}")
```

- *What is a frame? And nframes?*
Every time when we do the rendering, it is the default manner of the code to create 100 frames, or you can say, 100 plots.

#### :five: Other useful functions

Still, there's more to find out about gganimate.\

- **enter_\*()** and **exit_\*()** to control what happens with data that does not persist
during a tween. In general the non-persistent data is transformed to an invisible version that can be tweened to, e.g. by setting the opacity to 0.

If preferred, here is an example for enter_\*() and exit_\*() . :sparkles:

```{r, fig.align='center'}
anim2 <- ggplot(iris, aes(x=Petal.Width, y=Petal.Length,
                          color=Species, size=2)) +
  geom_point() +
  transition_states(Species,
                    transition_length=2,
                    state_length=1)

# The states are so different since we color the points by Species, 
# it will be confused for our code to understand how to change from one state to another, 
# so it will be better if we simply tell it how.

anim2 +
  enter_fade() +
  exit_shrink()
```

\

- **anim_save()** to save your GIF file to your own computer, using similar grammar like ggsave().\
