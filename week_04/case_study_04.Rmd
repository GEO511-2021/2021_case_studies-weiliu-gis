## The R packages we need

To begin with, we activate 2 packages, namely *tidyverse* and *nycflights13* in our workplace.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
```

## Find the farthest airport

To do the task, we need 2 tables - *flights* and *airports* - in the *nycflights13* dataset. And also, there are some functions we may want, such as **arrange()**, **inner_join()**, etc.

```{r}
flights %>%
  arrange(desc(distance)) %>%
  slice(1) %>% # keep only the first row, since there are many duplicates
  inner_join(airports, by=c("dest"="faa")) %>%
  select(name) %>% # keep only the "name" column
  as.character() # change the data frame to characters
```


:) Now we get the answer. The farthest airport is "Honolulu Intl".
